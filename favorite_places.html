    <h1>About Arizona</h1>

    <p>Arizona (Listeni/ɛrɪˈzoʊnə/; /ærɪˈzoʊnə/) (Navajo: Hoozdo Hahoodzo; O'odham: Alĭ ṣonak)<p> is a state in the southwestern region of the United States. It is also part of the Western United States and of <p>the Mountain West states. It is the sixth largest and the 14th most populous of the 50 states.<p> Its capital and largest city is Phoenix. Arizona is one of the Four Corners states. It has borders with New <p>Mexico, Utah, Nevada, California, and Mexico, and one point in common with the southwestern corner of Colorado. Arizona's border with Mexico is 389 miles (626 km) long, on the <p>northern border of the Mexican states of Sonora and Baja California.

    <h2>48th state</h2>
    <p>Arizona is the 48th state and last of the contiguous states to be admitted to the Union,<p> achieving statehood on February 14, 1912. It was previously part of the territory of Alta California in New Spain<p> before being passed down to independent Mexico and later ceded to the United States after <p>the Mexican–American War. The southernmost portion of the state was acquired in 1853 through the Gadsden Purchase.<p>

    <p>Southern Arizona is known for its desert climate, with very hot summers and mild winters.<p> Northern Arizona features forests of pine, Douglas fir, and spruce trees; the Colorado Plateau; some mountain ranges<p> (such as the San Francisco Mountains); as well as large, deep canyons, with much more <p>moderate summer temperatures and significant winter snowfalls. There are ski resorts in the areas of Flagstaff, <p>Alpine, and Tucson. In addition to the Grand Canyon National Park, there are several national forests, national parks, and national monuments. About one-quarter of the state[7]<p> is made up of Indian reservations that serve as the home of <p>a number of Native American tribes.</p>
